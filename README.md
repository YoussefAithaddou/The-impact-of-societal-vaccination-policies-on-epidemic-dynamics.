# The-impact-of-societal-vaccination-policies-on-epidemic-dynamics.
The objective of this project is to analyze the impact of societal vaccination
policies on epidemic dynamics. Since he problem can be seen as an optimization
problem of costs with respect to benefits, I used SIR (susceptible, infected and recovered) model to analyze different edpidemics and to find the optimal vaccination policy.
